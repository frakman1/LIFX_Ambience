what I did to move it from local Xcode git world to github world:

created a repo on github, got the URL
added the URL to the locall .git/config file
ran :
git remote add origin https://github.com/frakman1/LIFX_Ambience.git
git push origin master (didnâ€™t work) (fiddled with the UI app) then:
git pull origin master
git push origin master
